PRacting GIT

A good day to learn git.

About time I learn git from the command line!!!!!!

Remember to read that Paris Review article about Gordon Lish.

Buy the London Review of Books too, this month.

Morning, it's Monday and it's time to see if we still remember BASIC GIT STUFF, do we? 

And a little more because I UNSTAGED SOMETHING, using git unstage HEAD <file>. So let's see what happens.
